MOD_JW_TS_TABS_AND_SLIDERS_MODULE_BY_JOOMLAWORKS="Tabs & Sliders is the module adaptation of the highly successful Tabs & Sliders [for articles] plugin for Joomla!. The module adaptation brings all the goodies of the plugin and new functionality to help you easily organize your modules in tabs or sliders. The tabs emulate a multi-page structure, while the sliders emulate an accordion-like structure, inside a single page! Your content is organized better and there is no need for your visitors to scroll through a large page!"
